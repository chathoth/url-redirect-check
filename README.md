# Jenkins Pipeline for Checking Redirects

## Overview
This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline setup to check redirects from a source URL to a destination URL, using a Python script. The pipeline prompts the user to upload a CSV file containing source and destination paths, executes the Python script, and generates a report in Jenkins.

## Requirements
- Jenkins installed and configured
- Python 3 installed
- `requests` library for Python installed (`pip install requests`)

## Usage
1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   ```
   cd <repository_directory>
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Jenkins Pipeline**:
   - Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
   - Set the pipeline script source to pull from the repository.

4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Trigger the pipeline manually or set up triggers based on changes to the repository.
   - Upload a CSV file with source and destination paths when prompted.

5. **View Report**:
   - Once the pipeline completes execution, view the generated HTML report in the Jenkins build report section.

## Jenkinsfile
The Jenkinsfile defines the pipeline stages:
- Upload CSV: Prompts the user to upload a CSV file.
- Execute Python Script: Runs the Python script with the provided CSV file path.
- Post-build Action: Publishes an HTML report generated by the Python script.

## Python Script (script.py)
The Python script reads source and destination paths from a CSV file, appends a domain name, checks redirects, and generates a report.

## CSV Format
The CSV file should contain two columns: source path and destination path.

## Additional Notes
- Modify the `DOMAIN_NAME` variable in the Jenkinsfile to specify the domain to check redirects against.
- Update paths and file names in the Jenkinsfile and Python script as needed based on your project structure.
